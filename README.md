# Robocode DQN project
## Setup instruction:
1. Add robocode dependencies to local maven repository using `robocode_maven_import.sh` script (assuming that you have maven installed)
2. Change `option name="WORKING_DIRECTORY"` to point to wherever your robocode is installed (relatively to the project directory)
3. Try to run the application using run IntelliJ run configuration - everything should work, and you should see the `QLearningRobot` in robocode
